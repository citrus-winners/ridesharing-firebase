## Requirements

Firebase Cloud Functions require a paid account to make outbound API calls. This includes API calls to HyperTrack APIs. We recommend using the Blaze plan. It gives a lot of bandwidth for free, which is more then enough to internally test the app.

## Add to your project

1. Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hypertrack/ridesharing-firebase.git
cd ridesharing-firebase
```

2. Install Firebase tools CLI

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

3. Login to your account and choose your project

```bash
firebase login
firebase use --add
```
Select the project from dropdown menu. You can use any alias for the project.

4. Install function dependencies

```bash
cd functions ; npm install ; cd ..
```

5. Configure functions with HyperTrack API Keys

Copy `AccountId` and `SecretKey` from HyperTrack's dashboard [setup page](https://dashboard.hypertrack.com/setup). Paste them in `/functions/index.js` file into [placeholders on line 9](https://github.com/hypertrack/ridesharing-firebase/blob/875bf0a719153eecdd6eb5694e4a1c715142d242/functions/index.js#L9). Keep the `:` separator between them.

6. Deploy functions into your Firebase Ridesharing project

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

7. Setup webhooks from HyperTrack to Cloud Functions

* Open the Functions > Dashboard tab in your Firebase project
* Copy the trigger URL for `onTripUpdate` function
  ![Functions Dashboard](Images/FunctionsDashboard.png)
* Go to HyperTrack's dashboard [setup page](https://dashboard.hypertrack.com/setup) and add this URL as a webhook URL.

8. Your Cloud Functions backend is now ready to interface with HyperTrack APIs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* [No project active](#no-project-active)
* [Error parsing triggers: Cannot find module 'moment'](#error-parsing-triggers-cannot-find-module-moment)

### No project active

```
No project active. Run with --project <projectId> or define an alias by
running firebase use --add
```

This error while deploying functions means that you need to select the project first. Run `firebase use --add` and select your project from dropdown menu, then add any alias to the project.

### Error parsing triggers: Cannot find module 'moment'

This error can happen when your didn't run `npm install` from the `functions` directory. Run `cd functions ; npm install ; cd ..` from the projects directory or execute the commands one by one:

```bash
cd functions
npm install
cd ..
```
